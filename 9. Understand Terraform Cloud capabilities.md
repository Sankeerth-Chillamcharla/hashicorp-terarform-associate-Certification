## Feature of Terraform Cloud 

* Provides collaboration, infrastructure as code (IaC) workflows
* Managing Terraform configurations across teams
* Enabling the Version control, Collaboration and remote execution
* Securely store the `terraform state file` and manage the variables and sensitive data.
* Automate the `terraform apply`
*  Managing the multiple project in organization level 
*  It also automatically locks state during operations to prevent concurrent modifications that may corrupt the state file.
* Terraform Cloud also has a private registry for sharing your organization's Terraform modules and providers.

### Terraform Cloud workflow 

1. CLI- driven -> which uses Terraform's standard CLI tools to execute runs in Terraform Cloud.
2. GUI ->  in which changes pushed to version control repositories trigger runs in the associated workspace.
3. API-driven -> Which allows you to create tooling to interact with the Terraform Cloud API programmatically.
